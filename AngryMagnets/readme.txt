ANGRY MAGNETS

by David Traviolia, Benjamin Paren, and Nathaniel Verhaaren

Directions:
Prevent the enemies (the red squares) from reaching their goal (the orange target) by firing particles at them.

The up and down arrow keys can be used to adjust the angle of the cannon.
The left and right arrow keys can be used to adjust the speed the particles are fired at. The larger the green power bar, the faster they are shot.

Press space to fire.
Press escape to exit at any time.

An enemy is removed when it is close enough to an explosion. An explosion is caused by firing a particle into a pink
antimatter wall, as opposed to a regular black wall, which it will bounce off.

The green dots or x's represent magnetic fields out of or into the screen, respectively, while the direction of an electric field is represented by the blue lines. Note that the particle is negatively charged. Particles have no noticeable effect on each other because their charge is too small.


The src folder contains the code, the bin folder contains the classes.

The project can be run by running GameRunner.class in the bin folder.
The project can also be run by running AngryMagnets.jar in this directory. (Double-clicking should suffice).

Enjoy!

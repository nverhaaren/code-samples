## Recent Projects

### Houghton
An ongoing project that I am currently working on. I am tracking a particular flight that I sometimes have occasion to use to see how often it experiences delays, and if I can correlate that to time of year, etc. It is partly in Python, partly Bash script.

### Pwned
I recently (August 2017) downloaded the breached passwords archives from [have I been pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and wrote some scripts to work with them, since there are obvious security problems with sending your currently used passwords over the internet to a mysterious third party. Of course, there are also problems downloading other people's scripts to do essentially the same thing, but the Python scripts and C program (which splits up the large text file into several smaller ones for easier searching and is written in C so it doesn't take forever like its Python equivalent) are simple enough that if you know the languages, you can download them and look over them and be confident that they do not do anything untoward with the passwords entered.

### Chess
I created this text-only chess program in C++ in 2012. This year (2017) I fixed a couple of longstanding bugs. There's a partially implemented tool to read and write moves in algebraic chess notation, which I intend to flesh out more fully. I also plan to make revisions to the code, since my style has improved over the last five years.

### GEB
Two Standard ML programs that I wrote in 2017 implementing formal systems from Douglas Hofstadter's _Godel, Escher, Bach_. mu.sml implements the MU game, and strict-logical.sml implements his Propositional Calculus. In each one, when the script is run, the user can enter 'theorems' that follow from the previous strings obtained. Only strings that follow the rules will be accepted.

## Other Major Projects

### AngryMagnets
Two others and I created this three-level physics-based game as a final project in high school. It is more addictive than you might think, although it has performance issues as it is written in Java and tries to accurately simulate the behavior of a large number of charged particles in various fields. 

## Other Projects

### Skyline
A project that I wrote in Java in high school. It animates a skyline with four sky scrapers, as well as a clock.

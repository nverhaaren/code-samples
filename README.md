## Houghton
An ongoing project that I am currently working on. I am tracking a particular flight that I sometimes have occasion to use to see how often it experiences delays, and if I can correlate that to time of year, etc. It is partly in Python, partly Bash script.

## Skyline
A project that I wrote in Java in high school. It animates a skyline with four sky scrapers, as well as a clock.

## AngryMagnets
Two others and I created this three-level physics-based game as a final project in high school. It is more addictive than you might think, although it has performance issues as it is written in Java and tries to accurately simulate the behavior of a large number of charged particles in various fields. 

## GEB
Two Standard ML programs that I wrote in 2017 implementing formal systems from Douglas Hofstadter's _Godel, Escher, Bach_. mu.sml implements the MU game, and strict-logical.sml implements his Propositional Calculus. In each one, when the script is run, the user can enter 'theorems' that follow from the previous strings obtained. Only strings that follow the rules will be accepted.

## Chess
I created this text-only chess program in C++ in 2012. There's a partially implemented tool to read and write moves in algebraic chess notation, but my immediate focus will be tracking down a bug that seems to make the game think the king is in check when it is not.
